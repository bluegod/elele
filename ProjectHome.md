**Elele** is a MSN Messenger to IRC gateway made in Java using the [JML library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-jml/). This means that you can 'chat' with your MSN friends using the IRC client you like!

It has support for common IRC commands used in a MSN way, like /AWAY to set your away status. You will see when someone goes online/offline in time, and of course there are 'virtual' people (bots) for helping you setting your MSN/IRC options!

It supports personal messages, display pictures and using a IRC Bouncer you could quit your IRC client and restore your session in other place, and so connecting to Elele and check the messages other left to you while you were still online but not using any client!
